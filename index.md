## About Me
I am the third-year Ph.D student in the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management from the <a href="https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/" target="_blank"> Chinese University of Hong Kong</a>, supervised by <a href="https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~htwai/" target="_blank"> Prof. Hoi-To Wai</a>. Before that, I received my bachelor degree in Control Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University. 
My research involves network science and graph learning problem and optimization algorithms and theory for machine learning.

**I am actively looking for postdoc position starting from <font color=red>August 2025</font>!**
