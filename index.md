## About Me
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://www.se.cuhk.edu.hk/" target="_blank"> Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management </a> from The  Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by <a href="https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~htwai/" target="_blank"> Prof. Hoi-To Wai</a>. Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Control Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University. 

My research interest focuses on graph signal processing, network science, and the development of optimization algorithms and theoretical approaches in machine learning.
